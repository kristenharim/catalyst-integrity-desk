# Limits

What each guard actually proves, stated at the strength the evidence supports and no
higher. Everything here was found by breaking the thing and watching what happened, not
by reading the code and reasoning about it.

This file exists because the project's pitch is that it does not flatter itself. A judge
who finds one of these unaided has found a hole. A judge who reads them here has found a
team that already looked.

## The ledger detects modification, not deletion

`verify()` walks the hash chain and recomputes each link. It catches any edit to a byte
inside a hashed payload, which is the demo, and that demo is real.

It does not catch these, all three verified by running them:

| Attack | Result |
|---|---|
| Delete the newest entry, leave the rest untouched | `verify()` returns `True`, badge stays green |
| Delete a middle entry and rehash its descendants | undetectable by construction |
| Replace the whole file with a fresh, internally valid chain | `verify()` returns `True` |

The third one is the sharpest. A chain was built whose belief claim read "Rocket is
comfortably funded and no financing is required", and `verify()` accepted it.

The reason is structural: a bare hash chain proves the **presented** chain is
self-consistent. It cannot prove that it is the **original** chain, because nothing
outside the file pins what the head should be. Nothing in the repo currently records an
expected head hash or entry count.

The fix is an external anchor: record the head hash and entry count somewhere the ledger
writer does not own, and have `verify()` compare against it. Until that exists, say
"detects tampering with recorded decisions", never "append-only" and never "immutable".

## The fabrication guard catches invented magnitudes, not wrong units

`_fabricated()` flags any number in the model's output that appears nowhere in its input.
The rule is deliberately not "no digits", because quoting a figure from the belief's own
claim text is quotation rather than invention.

Verified behaviour, given an input containing `-14.5` and `10.4`:

| Model output | Flagged |
|---|---|
| "The gap is 47.2 months" | yes, caught |
| "The funding gap is -14.5 **years**" | no |
| "The shortfall is 14.5 **million dollars**" | no |
| "Runway fell 10.4**%**" | no |
| "The gap is roughly **fourteen** months" | no |
| "Runway ends about **twice as long** as assumed" | no |

So a correct magnitude wearing the wrong unit, scale, or sign passes, as does any
quantitative claim expressed in words. The guard bounds invention. It does not bound
misuse of a number it was legitimately given, and it cannot see numbers that are not
digits.

Stronger versions, in increasing cost: normalise Unicode and detect number words before
scanning; require quoted figures to carry the unit and entity from a single contiguous
source span; or forbid quantitative expressions in generated prose entirely and render
every figure from the application.

## The provenance test detects unintended displayed literals

It parses rendered HTML, extracts every number-like token from text nodes, and asserts
each appears in `data/snapshot.json`. It caught a planted `9999` and a template-computed
value, both watched failing.

What it does not establish:

- **Substring, not equality.** `"%.3f"` of `-0.5913757700205339` renders `-0.591`, a
  literal prefix of the stored value, and passes.
- **Text nodes only.** SVG coordinates, stroke widths and other attribute values are never
  examined. This is deliberate, since geometry is not a claim about the world.
- **Presence, not correspondence.** A number can be real, present in the snapshot, and
  attached to the wrong row, field, unit or sign. The check cannot tell.
- **Rendering fidelity is unproven.** Verified by mutation: setting `prior_gap_months` to
  `99.9` while the page still displayed `8.4` left every test green, as did setting
  `runway.cash` to `1.0` while the page still displayed `$50M`.

The upgrade is per-element binding: every semantic figure carries the record and field
path it came from, and the test resolves that path and asserts the formatter's exact
output. Global substring matching then stays as defence in depth.

## Lapsed-versus-future is decided at build time, against wall clock

`build()` splits pivotal trials on `date.today()` unless an `as_of` is passed. Two
consequences:

- A committed snapshot's classification is a statement about the day it was built. Rebuild
  it later and rows can move from future to lapsed without any source data changing.
- Equality is not pinned. A completion date falling exactly on the build date currently
  counts as future, by `>=`, and that choice is incidental rather than argued.

Month-only registry dates (`2028-04`) are parsed to the first of the month, which is the
conservative direction, but it is a parser default doing policy work.

For a frozen demo this is sound, because the snapshot is the artifact. For anything
running continuously it is not, and the fix is to thread the snapshot's own `as_of`
through the split rather than reading the clock.

## Untested, and known to be

- The decision receipt's two hashes. Breaking the `entry_hash` lookup leaves every test
  green. The values were verified against the ledger file by hand, which is not a test.
- Whether a rebuild is reproducible. Nothing asserts that building twice from the same
  inputs produces the same bytes, so a hand-edited snapshot would not be detected.
- Concurrency anywhere. Two decisions appended at once are untested; the ledger has no
  compare-and-swap on the head.

## Where these came from

The first four sections were produced by a three-model adversarial review (Claude, Cursor,
Codex) asked specifically which existing checks were hollow, and then every claim it made
was run against the code before being written down here. Two of its predictions were
right, verified above. The transcript is in `runtime/council/` in the vault repo.
